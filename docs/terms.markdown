## Q-Tune Shipping and Return Policies
Updated 31 May 2025

### Transit Times
Although we try to ship all orders as quickly as possible, transit times are not guaranteed. No refunds or credits will be given due to shipments arriving after the estimated delivery date. Any claims should be filed with the carrier.

#### **Pre-Orders**

If you have purchased a pre-order kit and the kit has not shipped to you within 45 business days, you have the option of requesting a refund. In that unlikely event, we will contact you directly with an update and steps of how to request a refund if you choose.

### International Shipping Methods

- Internation shipping may not be available during the pre-order period. If/when that changes, we will update the information available here.

### Returns / Refunds

In most cases unused items can be returned for a refund within 30 days of ordering. Items must be returned in the same condition as shipped. Shipping charges / payment processing fees will not be refunded, and return shipping is the customer's responsibility.

### Returned Shipments

Packages returned for any reason will be reshipped at the customer's expense. If reshipment is not possible a refund will be issued minus any shipping costs and payment processing fees.

### Customs duties / tariffs

Molinello Music & Q-Tune are not responsible for any customs fees, duties, or tariffs that are owed upon receiving your shipment. Packages will be declared at actual value. We cannot falsify customs declaration information.

### California Prop 65 Heath & Safety Warning

**WARNING**: These parts can expose you to chemicals including nickel compounds, chromium, and lead, which are known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. For more information go to [www.P65Warnings.ca.gov](https://www.P65Warnings.ca.gov){:target="_blank"}.
