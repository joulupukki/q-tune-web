**Q-Tune**™ Chromatic Instrument Tuner is a next-generation guitar tuner pedal designed for players who want pro-level precision with DIY-level satisfaction.

It’s not just another tuner — it’s a visually stunning, high-performance tool built to deliver fast, accurate tuning on a beautiful 2.8” color display, all housed in a rugged aluminum enclosure that you assemble yourself.

At its core, Q-Tune uses an advanced pitch detection algorithm to lock onto your note with incredible speed and stability. The dynamic display gives you real-time visual feedback in a way that’s clear, responsive, and easy to read on dark stages or bright practice rooms.

## Why Q-Tune?

• **Unmatched Display Clarity**: A crisp, full-color screen shows your pitch in vivid detail — no more squinting at tiny LEDs.

• **High-Precision Tuning**: Built around a powerful ESP32 chip and a custom pitch engine for rock-solid accuracy.

• **DIY Kit Format**: Every pedal comes as a through-hole kit you build yourself — no surface-mount soldering required.

• **Built to Last**: A tough 125B / 1590B (your choice) aluminum enclosure gives Q-Tune stage-ready durability.

• **Beautiful, Functional UI**: Multiple built-in tuning modes with visually expressive interfaces that are as fun as they are functional.

Whether you’re a tone-chasing guitarist, a gear-loving tinkerer, or just someone who appreciates smart design, **Q-Tune delivers a premium tuning experience that you build with your own hands**.
