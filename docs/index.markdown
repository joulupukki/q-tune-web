    <p>Q-Tune™ Chromatic Instrument Tuner is the <strong>first of its kind</strong> in the <strong>DIY</strong> pedal world — a <strong>high-precision</strong> tuner with a full <strong>2.8&quot; LCD</strong>, offered as a <strong>solder-it-yourself kit</strong> in a rugged stompbox enclosure.</p>

    <p>At its core, Q-Tune uses an advanced pitch detection algorithm to lock onto your note with incredible speed and stability. The dynamic display gives you real-time visual feedback in a way that’s clear, responsive, and easy to read on dark stages or bright practice rooms.</p>

    <p>Build it yourself. Gig with confidence. Pro-level precision with DIY-level satisfaction.</p>

## ✅ Why Q-tune Is Different

- **🔬 Ultra-Accurate Tuning Engine**<br/>Tracks pitch with high precision.

- **📺 Big, Bright 2.8" LCD Display**<br/>Visible in the dark, crisp on stage, easy on the eyes.

- **🎚️ Buffered Bypass Option**<br/>Clean, transparent signal when engaged or bypassed. Especially handy at the beginning of your pedalboard chain or when driving a long cable to your amp. Or, use the tuner in true bypass, your choice!

- **🖥️ Multiple Tuning Display Styles**<br/>Choose between several visual layouts – meter, strobe-inspired, big letter display, and more.<br/>_(All styles support full-range chromatic tuning.)_

- **🎧 Monitoring Mode**<br/>Watch pitch in real-time while playing – ideal for intonation and practice (using buffered bypass).

- **🔌 USB-C Firmware Upgrades**<br/>Future-proof your build - update firmware with new feaures or improvements via USB-C using the [web installer](/install).

- **🧰 Real DIY Experience**<br/>No code to write, no guesswork – pro-quality parts and PCB, ready to solder.

- **📏 Two Footprint Options**<br/>Choose the classic **125B** or tight-packed **1590B** size (select at checkout).

- **🛠️ First of Its Kind**<br/>Q-Tune is the first DIY pedal kit to offer **a full-color display, studio-grade accuracy**, and a **rugged enclosure** – all as a legit built-it-yourself project.
