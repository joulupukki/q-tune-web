## What is Q-Tune?

Q-Tune is the first DIY guitar tuner pedal kit designed for musicians, builders, and tinkerers who want a customizable and high-performance tuner they can build and modify themselves.

## When will Q-Tune be available?

It's coming *very soon*! Sign up on the Q-Tune home page for our newsletter and you'll be among the first to know when it's available.

## Is Q-Tune available for purchase?

Q-Tune will be available as a DIY kit. You will be able to purchase a full kit that includes the PCB and required components from the Q-Tune website. We will provide full assembly instructions.

## Do I need to know how to solder?

Yes. The Q-Tune kit requires intermediate soldering skills. If you're new to soldering, we recommend practicing on a simple beginner kit first before attempting to assemble Q-Tune.

## What tools do I need to build Q-Tune?

At minimum, you'll need:

- A soldering iron and solder

- Wire cutters/strippers

- A small Phillips screwdriver

- A multimeter

- A headworn magnifier (optional but extremely helpful)

## What’s included in the kit?

- Pre-flashed ESP32 module

- 2.8" Capacitive Touch LCD Display

- Custom PCB + all needed components

- Mounting hardware

- A painted aluminum enclosure

- Full assembly guide (downloadable on the [build](/build) page

## Can I update the software?

When new versions are available, you can upgrade your Q-Tune pedal with the [web installer](/install) using a standard USB-C data cable.

## What tuning algorithm does it use?

Q-Tune uses an advanced zero-crossing detection algorithm (it's actually more complicated than that). It’s designed for fast and accurate pitch detection, optimized for stringed instruments like guitar and bass.

## Can it tune instruments other than guitar?

Yes, though it’s optimized for standard guitar and bass tuning ranges.

## Is there a warranty?

Since Q-Tune is a DIY kit, we cannot offer a formal warranty. However, please join the [Q-Tune Builder's Discord](https://discord.gg/C5VnyGkc){:target="_blank"} and we or other builders may be able to help you troubleshoot.

## Is this project suitable for beginners?

Q-Tune is best suited for intermediate builders who have experience with soldering and basic electronics. If you're new to DIY audio projects, you may want to get some practice first, or enlist help from a more experienced friend. But, if you're determined, by all means, go for it!

## Will there be future versions or improvements?

We're always looking for improvements and new features. If there's something you'd love to see, please let us know. As newer versions are avaiable, we will post them on the [web installer](/install) page.

## How can I get support?

There are also many great pedal building forums that may help, including PedalPCB, All About Circuits, and GroupDIY.
