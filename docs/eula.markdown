1. General
(a) The software (including Boot ROM code, embedded software and third party software), documentation, interfaces, content, fonts and any data that came with your Device (“Software”), as may be updated or replaced by feature enhancements, software updates, security responses, system files, or system restore software provided by Molinello Music for your Device (“Software Changes”), whether in read only memory, on any other media or in any other form (the Original Software and Software Changes are collectively referred to as the “Software”) are licensed, not sold, to you by Molinello Music (“Molinello Music”) for use only under the terms of this License. Molinello Music and its licensors retain ownership of the Software itself and reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

(b) Molinello Music, at its discretion, may make available future Software Changes. The Software Changes, if any, may not necessarily include all existing software features or new features that Molinello Music releases for newer or other models of Devices. The terms of this License will govern any Software Changes provided by Molinello Music, unless such Software Change is accompanied by a separate license, in which case you agree that the terms of that license will govern.

2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.  
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you are granted a limited non-exclusive license to use the Software on a single Device. Except as permitted in Section 2(b) below, and unless as provided in a separate agreement between you and Molinello Music, this License does not allow the Software to exist on more than one Device at a time, and you may not distribute or make the Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple Devices at the same time.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you are granted a limited non-exclusive license to download Software Changes that may be made available by Molinello Music for your model of the Device to update or restore the software on any such Device that you own or control. This License does not allow you to update or restore any Device that you do not control or own, and you may not distribute or make the Software Changes available over a network where they could be used by multiple Devices at the same time. If you download a Software Change to your computer, you may make one copy of the Software Changes stored on your computer in machine-readable form for backup purposes only, provided that the backup copy must include all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original.

(c) You may not, and you agree not to or enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt, modify, or create derivative works of the Software or any services provided by the Software or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or by licensing terms governing use of open-source components that may be included with the Software).
