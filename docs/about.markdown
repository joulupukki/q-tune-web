On June 17, 2024, [Boyd Timothy](http://www.boydtimothy.com/){:target="_blank"} stumbled across a small preamp kit that Ryan Schultz was selling on the Acoustic Guitar Forum Classifieds. Impressed by the clever design of Ryan’s “T-Pre” kit, Boyd reached out—and the rest, as they say, is history.

What started as a simple message turned into a full-blown collaboration. When Ryan floated the idea of creating a DIY guitar tuner kit, Boyd was all in. The two began trading ideas, testing ESP32 dev boards, and refining circuits late into the night—for months.

After nearly a year of prototyping, tinkering, and fine-tuning, **Q-Tune** was born—the world’s first **DIY guitar tuner pedal kit**. It’s built for makers, tinkerers, and tone chasers who want more than off-the-shelf gear.

Q-Tune: A pro-level tuner that **YOU build yourself**.
