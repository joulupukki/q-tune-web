  <hr />

  <p>On June 17, 2024, <a href="http://www.boydtimothy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boyd Timothy</a> stumbled across a small preamp kit that Ryan Schultz was selling on the Acoustic Guitar Forum Classifieds. Impressed by the clever design of Ryan's "T-Pre" kit, Boyd reached out—and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>

  <p>What started as a simple message turned into a full-blown collaboration. When Ryan floated the idea of creating a DIY guitar tuner kit, Boyd was all in. The two began trading ideas, testing ESP32 dev boards, and refining circuits late into the night—for months.</p>

  <p>After nearly a year of prototyping, tinkering, and fine-tuning, <strong>Q-Tune</strong> was born—the world's first <strong>DIY guitar tuner pedal kit</strong>. It's built for makers, tinkerers, and tone chasers who want more than off-the-shelf gear.</p>
